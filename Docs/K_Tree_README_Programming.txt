//Programming and testing
//Activate your virtual environment by running:
source .venv/bin/activate
//I am using Thonny to write the program
//Open Thonny
In the bottom right of the Thonny window, you can change the python interpreter.
Set it to the python3 that is located inside the virtual environment.
For example: /home/rpi/Documents/K_Tree/.venv/bin/python3

Now you can run the program from within Thonny.

//To run the program from the terminal with the virtual environment activated
python k_tree.py
